The Tools & Resources I'm Using to Structure My Self-Directed Learning Path to Becoming a Software Engineer

Thanks to @chrisachard for the extremely helpful post about [how to write your first post on DEV](https://dev.to/chrisachard/how-to-write-your-first-post-on-dev-c3k) and to @Maxime on [how to manage your dev.to blog posts from a GIT repo](https://dev.to/maxime1992/manage-your-dev-to-blog-posts-from-a-git-repo-and-use-continuous-deployment-to-auto-publish-update-them-143j)

*I will be making this into a monthly post series where I highlight the tools and resources I'm currently using in my self-directed journey*
